<p> 
    I am a 1st year graduate student of Software engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka. My
    professional development is directed towards a career in full-stack development. Therefore
    I see my future in working for companies that
    inspire me to always look for a better solution in development, such as
    Degordian or Infinum.
